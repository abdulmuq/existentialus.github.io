####Will Ohio get affected due to Jonas?

No. It doesn’ t look like Ohio will get affected.

####How do you prepare for a blizzard?

To prepare for a winter storm you should do the following:

#####**Stock up on Enough Food and water**

When you’re locked into your home, the last thing you want to deal with is shortage of food and water. Canned food., fresh vegetables and meat. If you’re worried about power – just keep the food that you want to preserve outside your door or in your garage (closer to the outdoors). The cold is enough to preserve food.

#####**Before storm approaches, add the following supplies to your emergency kit:**

1. Rock salt or more environmentally safe products to melt ice on walkways.

2. A shovel

3. Windshield scraper and small broom

4. Extra batteries

5. Extra hats, socks and mittens

6. First aid kit with pocket knife

7. Necessary medications

8. Blanket(s)

9. Tow chain or rope

10. Road salt and sand

11. Booster cables

12. Snow shovels and other snow removal equipment.

13. Sufficient heating fuel. You may become isolated in your home and regular fuel sources may be cut off. Store a good supply of dry, seasoned wood for your fireplace or wood-burning stove.

14. Adequate clothing and blankets to keep you warm.

#####**Minimize travel.** If travel is necessary, keep a disaster supplies kit in your vehicle.

#####**Bring pets/companion animals** inside during winter weather. Move other animals or livestock to sheltered areas with non-frozen drinking water.

#####**Winterize Your Vehicle.**

Check or have a mechanic check the following items on your car:

*Antifreeze levels* - ensure they are sufficient to avoid freezing.

*Install good winter tires on your vehicles* - Make sure the tires have adequate tread. All-weather radials are usually adequate for most winter conditions. However, some jurisdictions require that to drive on their roads, vehicles must be equipped with chains or snow tires with studs.

#####**Get snow chains if necessary.**

#####**Watch for Blizzard Warning** - Sustained winds or frequent gusts to 35 miles per hour or greater and considerable amounts of falling or blowing snow (reducing visibility to less than a quarter mile) are expected to prevail for a period of three hours or longer.

#####**Get Kerosene or other fuel in the event of a power loss.**

####And during the storm:

1. Stay indoors during the storm.

2. Walk carefully on snowy, icy, walkways.

3. Avoid overexertion when shoveling snow. Overexertion can bring on a heart attack—a major cause of death in the winter. Use
caution, take breaks, push the snow instead of lifting it when possible, and lift lighter loads.

4. Keep dry. Change wet clothing frequently to prevent a loss of body heat. Wet clothing loses all of its insulating value and transmits heat rapidly.

5. What to Do: Cover exposed skin, but do not rub the affected area in an attempt to warm it up. Seek medical help immediately.

6. Drive only if it is absolutely necessary. If you must drive: travel in the day; don’t travel alone; keep others informed of your schedule; stay on main roads and avoid back road shortcuts.

7. Let someone know your destination, your route, and when you expect to arrive. If your car gets stuck along the way, help can be sent along your predetermined route.

8. Maintain ventilation when using kerosene heaters to avoid build-up of toxic fumes. Refuel kerosene heaters outside and keep them at least three feet from flammable objects.

9. Conserve fuel, if necessary, by keeping your residence cooler than normal. Temporarily close off heat to some rooms.

10. If you must go outside, wear several layers of loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing rather than one layer of heavy clothing. The outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent.

11. Wear mittens, which are warmer than gloves.

12. Wear a hat. A hat will prevent loss of body heat.

13. Cover your mouth with a scarf to protect your lungs.

####If a blizzard traps you in the car:

1. Pull off the highway. Turn on hazard lights and hang a distress flag from the radio antenna or window.

2. Remain in your vehicle where rescuers are most likely to find you. Do not set out on foot unless you can see a building close by where you know you can take shelter. Be careful; distances are distorted by blowing snow. A building may seem close, but be too far to walk to in deep snow.

3. Run the engine and heater about 10 minutes each hour to keep warm. When the engine is running, open a downwind window slightly for ventilation and periodically clear snow from the exhaust pipe. This will protect you from possible carbon monoxide poisoning.

4. Exercise to maintain body heat, but avoid overexertion. In extreme cold, use road maps, seat covers, and floor mats for insulation. Huddle with passengers and use your coat for a blanket.

5. Take turns sleeping. One person should be awake at all times to look for rescue crews.

6. Eat regularly and drink ample fluids to avoid dehydration, but avoid caffeine and alcohol.

7. Be careful not to waste battery power. Balance electrical energy needs - the use of lights, heat, and radio - with supply.

8. Turn on the inside light at night so work crews or rescuers can see you.

9. If stranded in a remote area, stomp large block letters in an open area spelling out HELP or SOS and line with rocks or tree limbs to attract the attention of rescue personnel who may be surveying the area by airplane.

10. Leave the car and proceed on foot - if necessary - once the blizzard passes.
