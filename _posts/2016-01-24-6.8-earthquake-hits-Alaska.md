Here’s what you need to do in the event of an earthquake:

1. Keep calm and keep warm

2. Go out in the open when possible and remain there until aftershocks have subsided. 

3. If you’re stuck indoors, hide under sturdy tables. Stay away from large objects that might topple over.

4. Once you’re sure that the shocks have subsided, switch off power OR ensure that power lines have not snapped.

5. Ration food and water until you’re sure that things are normal.

6. Keep your games on your phone switched off, you might need that extra battery power during  an emergency.

7. Stay away from the shore.
