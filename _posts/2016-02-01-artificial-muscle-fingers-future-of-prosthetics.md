Building robotic systems that replicate the touch and grip of a human hand is a complex undertaking that has seen the development of all kinds of soft robotic grippers. Scientists at EPFL are now claiming a huge step forward in this area by demonstrating an ingenious robotic device that can easily grasp fragile objects with the help of electroadhesion, the exact same phenomenon that leads balloons to cling to ceilings after being rubbed on your hair. 

A team of EPFL scientists, led by Jun Shuntake have managed to develop a robotic system that mimics the action of the human thumb and the index finger, including the relaxation and contraction action of muscles. They claim that their device can grasp an object of any shape. 

They device consists flaps (functioning as fingers). The flap contains five layers: a pre-stretched elastomer in the middle with two layers of electrodes on either side, and then two layers of silicone on the outer. In its resting state, the flaps curl outwards. But when an electric current is supplied, the attraction between the two electrodes draws them together in an action that mimics muscle flexion. But the real fact for this type of robotic gripper is its electrostatic field, made possible by the interlocking electrodes at the tips of the flaps. 

Researchers demonstrated their device by picking up fragile items like an egg, balloon and a flat piece of paper. An interesting advantage claimed by the researchers is that this device does not require any prior knowledge about the shape of the object. It grasps objects by gently conforming its flaps to the surface. The electroadhesive affect assists it in carrying items 80 times its own weight. 

You can see the device at work in the video below.

The researchers claim that their innovation could be used in food handling, or the retrieval of space debris. But one of the most promising areas of application for this technology is prosthetics. 

During a session on artificial intelligence at the January 2016 World Economic Forum(WEF) in Davos, Andrew Moore of the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Sciences remarked that the seemingly simple task of picking up objects effectively is still a major limitation in robotics today. 

“Many people in the robotics world now are working on the simplest question of reliably picking up a drink,” he said. “Once we have that, there is the prospect that millions, maybe tens of millions of people around the world with impairments that are damaging their everyday life can actually have a robot arm or other [devices] on their wheelchairs, or even eventually on exoskeletons.”
