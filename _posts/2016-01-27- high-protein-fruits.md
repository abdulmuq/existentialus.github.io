Proteins are good substitutes for carbohydrates. They kill hunger, and prevent the body from accumulating fat. But even better is the fact that they have a specific function in the body, and that is related to cellular repairs and muscle building. Luckily, the body does not need much of them and anything in excess is promptly expelled by the body. Our diets therefore, need not have too many proteins.  But the lack of them, can lead to many health disorders such as, frequent infections, Kwashiorkor (‘edematous malnutrition’), difficulty in the quick healing of wounds, etc. The quantity of proteins human beings require is .8 grams for every kilo of their weight. The calories requirement differs based on one’s height, weight, age, lifestyle, etc.  In general, 2000-2500 calories per day can be consumed depending upon such factors. 

Proteins are plentiful in non-vegetarian diets. But that does not mean a vegetarian diet will leave people deficient in proteins. There are plenty of fruits that offer enough proteins. Here is a list of 10 such fruits, which have proteins in them and can be included in the diet for their protein content.
