![Existential - Shockingly salty food](/img/salt2.jpg)
 
The American Heart Association and the U.S. Government recommend 1500 to 2300 milligrams of sodium intake a day, that's about 3800 - 5800 milligrams of salt (100g salt contains 38.875g sodium). The suprising thing to note is that an average American ends up consuming much more than the above mentioned levels. Here's a list of food items which you'll need to reduce intake or avoid in order to stay within the specified sodium intake limits 
 
####Bread 
  
The commercially produced bread, being one of the most commonly consumed foods in America, contains some of the highest levels of sodium. Each slice of  bread contains 100-300 milligrams of sodium. Your breakfast toasts could easily provide you with a quarter of the daily recommended sodium value! 
Next time you buy bread, pay attention to the salt/sodium levels in it.  
The reason for adding salt is that it acts as a preservative. Also, the reason for bread not tasting as salty as it really is because the salt is baked into the bread, unlike chips, which has salt on its surface. 
 
####Fresh Chicken 
 
Chicken is a dietary staple among most Americans for its taste and lean proteins. Unfortunately, to increase the flavor and to make the meat juicy, the meat is injected with saltwater solution during processing. A serving (3-ounce) of unadulterated chicken contains only 60mg of sodium, but that of a processed chicken contains more than 300mg of sodium! 
Hence, be mindful of the type of chicken you buy. Chicken labelled organic generally contain lower levels sodium. 
 
####Canned vegetables 
 
Canned vegetables is a convenient and flavourful way of having your favourite veggies. As with any canned food, these contain preservatives, sauces and seasonings that add extra sodium. To give you an idea on the sodium content, a can of cream style corn contain around 730 milligrams of sodium.  
One way to getaround this excessive amounts of sodium is to rinse the vegetables before consuming or to buy cans mentioning 'no salt' or 'low sodium' 
 
####Marinades, sauces and flavourings 
 
Marinades and flavourings might be super tasty, but that comes at a price - interms of both money and health. A table spoon of soy sauce may contain around 1000 mg of sodium. Now, let that sink in a bit... 1000mg of sodium! Half a cup of spaghetti sauce which is barely enough to coat your pasta contains about 550 mg of sodium.  
So be super careful when you select your sauces and flavourings. 
 
####Frozen Dinners 
 
High convenience, taste and sodium! A frozen serving of turkey and gravy contains 787 mg sodium.  
Be sure to never fall into the habit of consuming frozen food regularly!
