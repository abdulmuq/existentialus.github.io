Well, if you haven't guessed it by the thumbnail yet, the enforcers being trained are eagles.  

For hundreds of years in the skies over Asia, eagles have been used to hunt down prey with lethal results. 
That tradition has been in decline for years. But now the bird's powerful talons, keen eyesight and lethal hunting instincts are being used again to take out a new kind of vermin - Rogue drones. 

Guard From Above is a Hague based company who describe themselves as "the world’s first company specialized in training birds of prey to intercept hostile drones." 

The Dutch Police, who been looking for ways to take down nuisance causing drones are Guard From Above's new customers. A police spokesman Dennis said that this operation is still in its testing  phase. "It's a low-tech solution to a high-tech problem," national police spokesman Dennis Janus told Reuters. He added: "People sometimes think it's a hoax, but it's proving very effective so far." 

The recent rise in drone technology has been matched by it's counterparts like signal jammers, and the Japanese net-wielding anti-drones. But these solution are less than ideal, and the search for an ideal solution is still on. 

“For years, the government has been looking for ways to counter the undesirable use of drones," Guard From Above's founder and chief executive, Sjoerd Hoogendoorn, said in a statement. “Sometimes a low-tech solution for a high-tech problem is more obvious than it seems. This is the case with our specially trained birds of prey. By using these birds’ animal instincts, we can offer an effective solution to a new threat.” 

The Dutch police released a video on Sunday showing the eagles in action. It shows two eagles in a warehouse with their handlers, taking out drones in the air. The drones are slightly smaller than the birds, and the birds are able to grasp them with their talons and bring them to the ground.

"The bird sees the drone as prey and takes it to a safe place, a place where there are no other birds or people," project spokesman Marc Wiebes told Dutch News.nl. "That is what we are making use of in this project." 

Said Hoogendoorn, according to Reuters: "These birds are used to meeting resistance from animals they hunt in the wild, and they don't seem to have much trouble with the drones." 
Janus, the police spokesman, told the Associated Press that the birds get a reward if they snag a drone. 

*Now all this sounds really cool, but what about the potential damage that may befall the eagles by the drone's propeller?* 

HawkQuest, a Colorado nonprofit that educates the public about birds of prey, says eagles have enough power to "crush large mammal bones" in animals such as sloths. 

"Scientists have tried to measure the gripping strength of eagles," HawQuest notes. "A Bald Eagle’s grip is believed to be about 10 times stronger than the grip of an adult human hand and can exert upwards of 400 psi or pounds per square inch." 

According to a study cited by Wired in 2009, raptor talons are not merely powerful, but also finely tuned hunting instruments: 
"...accipitrids, which include hawks and eagles, have two giant talons on their first and second toes. These give them a secure grip on struggling game that they like to eat alive, 'so long as it does not protest too vigorously. In this prolonged and bloody scenario, prey eventually succumb to massive blood loss or organ failure, incurred during dismemberment.'” 

A handler in the video, the Daily News notes, claims the birds are adequately protected by scales on their feet and legs, but researchers hope to equip the animals with another layer of defense. 

The final verdict on the usage of rogue drone enforcer eagles is still months away.
