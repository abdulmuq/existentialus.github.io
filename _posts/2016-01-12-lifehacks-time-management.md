'Time' is your most valuable possession. Almost everything in your life depends on how you manage and make use of your time. If you look at self made millionaires and billionaires, all of them manage and make use of their time excellently. You can better or make the most of your lives, by having a proper time routine.   
If you're having difficulties in managing, then you might find this list really helpful! 
So, here's our top tips for proper time management: 

####Do not procrastinate 
When it comes to time management, procrastination is your arch enemy. It is okay to procrastinate once in a while, but do not let your archenemy win (always) over you! 

####Create a daily plan  
You can do this early morning or during the night before. Creating a plan for the day keeps you reminded of the tasks that you need to complete at a particular time of the day. Strictly following your daily plan also helps you reduce procrastination. 

####Make use of technology (apps) 
Applications like Google calendars, organizers and time trackers are a simple and a great way to manage your time. They are freely available and are fairly easy to use. You just need to take the 'time' to set them up! 

####Leave buffer time between tasks 
People are not perfect. They can sometimes take more time than they initially they would. Hence, having some buffer time in-between tasks helps you cleanly manage your time, and avoid stress. 

####Bundle similar tasks together 
Bundling similar tasks together saves at least 25% of the total time spent on the tasks. Therefore, bundle tasks wherever you can! 

####Beware of time spent on social media 
According to the latest reports from GWI, an average person spends 100 minutes everyday on social media! Unless you make money on social media, highly limit your time on social media sites like Facebook and twitter. 

####Delegate 
If there are some not so important tasks or tasks that can be done better by others, delegate them. Doing so will help you manage the more important things at hand. 

####Do not fret over unimportant details 
Worrying over somethings, eats up your time, and to worry over something unimportant is simple not worth it. 

####Sleep well 
Try not to sacrifice your sleep. Identify your optimum sleeping hours per night (6-9 hours), and make it a priority to get your sleep. Getting your optimum sleep helps you keep up with the days task.  

####Learn to say 'No' 
Last but not the least, learn to say 'No'! Especially if you are an active person who's finding it difficult to manage your time. If you cannot say no, deter it to a later period.
