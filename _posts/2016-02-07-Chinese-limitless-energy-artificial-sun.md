The Chinese have moved a step closer to limitless energy via an 'Artificial Sun'

A team of researchers in eastern China have been able to produce Hydrogen that is 3 times hotter than the Sun's core, and have also managed to maintain the temperature for 102 seconds. The researchers claim that this breakthrough feat puts us a step closer to harness a new, artificial kind of solar energy for clean and unlimited energy.  

This experiment was conducted on a magnetic fusion reactor at the Institute of Physical Science in Hefei, China. The reactor is officially known as Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). It was able to heat ionized hydrogen gas (plasma) to about 50 million Kelvin (or ~90 million Fahrenheit), whereas, the core of the Sun is calculated to be 15 million Kelvin. The goal of the experiment was to approximate the nuclear fusion conditions that occur deep inside the sun.

The tokamak device uses powerful magnetic fields to confine plasma in the shape of a torus for safety reasons - due to the phenomenally high temperatures, duh.. The atoms are effectively held floating in place by superconducting magnets. The controlling hydrogen gas in such hot and volatile state is a great challenge, and one that most of the tokomak devices built over the last 60 years have not been able to sustain for more than 20 seconds. 

The scientists in Hefei worked “day and night” to achieve the record level of endurance, according to the institute, which serves as a subsidiary of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The team claimed to have solved a number of scientific and engineering problems, such as precisely controlling the alignment of the magnet, and managing to capture the high-energy particles and heat escaping from the “doughnut”. 

They still missed their goals by a huge margin though, which was to reach 100 million Kelvins for over 1,000 seconds (nearly 17 minutes) - they said, adding that it would still take several years to build a commercially viable plant that could operate in a stable manner. 

There have been experiments done in the last decade which claimed to produce hotter temperatures than the one's achieved at Hefei, but these experiments never crossed the endurance mark of 1 minute, mainly due to the concerns of provoking a reactor meltdown.
