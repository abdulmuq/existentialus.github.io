With snowfalls heavier than expected, most of SEPTA's public transportation services won't begin to come back online until 10 a.m. Sunday, at the earliest.

High winds created snow drifts that are covering tracks, interrupting power from the third rail and jamming switches and other equipment, he said. The agency has run pilot trains to clear tracks, but some routes and rail lines may not come back online until after 10 a.m. Sunday.

Subways ran with no significant delays in the city throughout Saturday, and that was expected to continue Sunday.

City trolleys and the Route 101 trolley were slated to resume operation Sunday morning, with delays likely. The Route 102 trolley likely won't begin running again until later Sunday.

Bus service will resume on a route-by-route basis, with priority given to the routes that feed the Market-Frankford and Broad Street lines. Riders should visit www.septa.org or call (215) 580-7800 for more information Sunday morning.
