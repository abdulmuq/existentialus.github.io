Is healthy food in schools a Myth? Well, not in Japan! 

In Japanese schools, lunchtime doesn't only mean healthy and tasty food, but it's about fun, discipline and valuable life ethics.

An elementary school from Saitama – Japan has a 45 minutes "lunch break" break which really is like any other educational period. The students learn to grow their own vegetables on the school’s farm, and even help peel them. They serve meals to their own peers inside their classroom while maintaining high hygienic conditions. After the meals, the students do full cleanups, including corridors and kitchen. Each step in the process is meticulously planned, yet collaborative and fun. On this particular day, the menu features five-vegetable soup, mashed potatoes and fish with pear sauce. All of the ingredients are wholesome and home-cooked. 

What started out as an educational video about lunch break in a Japanese school has now turned into a full on discussion about the quality of lunch in American schools. People on the internet is blown away by the school’s care and efficiency when it comes to health and food, along with the student’s genuine appreciation for their delicious meals and hard work going into them.  

Here's what some of the popular YouTube commenters say:  

*“Look at that, at a young age they’re taught to eat fish and healthy food some of which they’ve grown themselves. They are taught personal hygiene, how to serve food to their fellow classmates, clean after themselves after each meal, recycling and being thankful to the people who made the food for them.”*

*"I love this. I wish schools were ran this way here in the states.﻿"* 

*"Why are these Elementary students more polite and well behaved than the majority of kids in my high school?"*
