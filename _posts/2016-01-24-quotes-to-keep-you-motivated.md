JoyBell C.


#####*“At the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are, and you know what you want.”* ― Lao Tzu

#####*“the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.”* ― Jack Kerouac, On the Road

#####*“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”* - Mark Twain
