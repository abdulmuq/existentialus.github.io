There is a myth that one has to join a gym, weight watchers or eat some fancy diet to lose weight. Nothing could be further from the truth. The road to weight loss begins at home. The first thing to understand is that losing weight is not a painless procedure and the second thing is that you need to change your lifestyle. Changing lifestyle should be the key and it should be a permanent change.  
 
 
Start by cutting down on the calories. This does not have to be drastic but a gradual process. Cut down on 50-100 calories every few days. Eat one snack less everyday. You want to eat a diet that is no more than 1600-1800 calories. If you cut down drastically on your calorie intake, you will not be able to sustain such a diet. Just like you need air to breathe, humans also need a certain amount of food.

Exercise regularly. Most people falsely believe that they have to run a marathon every weekend or bicycle 100 kilometers every other day. Almost any exercise is better than no exercise. For those who hate exercising or want to start an exercise program, start walking. There is no easier way to exercise than walking. Walk at least 60 minutes everyday, seven days a week. You can expect to lose one pound a week at this rate. The best things about walking is that it does help people lose weight, it is FREE, allows you to enjoy nature and is safe- unless you get hit by a bus while texting.

Eat a healthy diet. There are 100s of diet plans on the market- most are not practical and simply designed to scam you. Use a common sense approach to diet. Eat lots of vegetables, fruits, lean meat and cut down on saturated fats, fatty meat and processed foods. There is absolutely no need to take any health supplements if you regularly eat fairly large variety of fruits.  
Keep in mind that there is no food that is bad as long as you eat in moderation. 
When you change your lifestyle for losing weight, you will need to cut down on the portions of food. Even if it is your birthday, avoid the desserts and the cake. Losing weight means sacrificing a lot of things if you want to be successful.

Discontinue all commercially available drinks like soft drinks and fruit juices (yes, most of currently available fruit juices are just as bad), instead drink freshly prepared fruit/vegetable juices and water. Water is the best drink actually, it contains no additives and has no calories - duh. You can drink as much water as you want to quench your thirst. All those formulas and equations on how much water to drink are nonsense. Our body is designed to tell you when you have had enough water. You can add a dash of lime to make the water even more refreshing and rejuvenating.

Finally if you want to lose weight at home, start today and be realistic. If it took you several years to gain some extra weight, then expect almost the same duration to lose weight without rigorous workouts. Start by becoming active at home. Do not sit and watch TV, instead do something that requires physical activity. Losing weight requires dedication and motivation. If you persist you will lose your goal.
