A photo of a monkey with visible stitches on its neck has been making its rounds online, along with a doctor's claims that his team has taken another step closer to realising their dream of carrying out a human head transplant.

According to New Scientist, Professor Ren Xiaoping from Harbin Medical University and his team restored the blood supply between the head and the new body, but did not attempt to connect the spinal cord.

Dr Sergio Canevero, the Italian surgeon who announced his plans to perform human head transplants in 2013, said that his counterpart in China has recently performed a successful surgery on a monkey.

Dr Canevero elaborated: "The monkey fully survived the procedure without any neurological injury of whatever kind," as the detached head had been cooled to -15 degree Celsius.

However, New Scientist reported that the surgeons' claims have not been verified and and their findings have yet to appear in a journal that has been reviewed by the medical community.

The procedure repeats the work of US neurosurgeon Robert White, who attempted the world's first head transplant on a monkey in 1970. It died several days after the procedure.

Dr Sergio Canevero, called on billionaires to fund a head transplant which is expected to cost in double digit millions of dollars. This despite the fact that no significant scientific studies have established the possibility of successful long term survival of patients, not to forget the fact that there are serious ethical concerns on such a procedure.

####Ethical Concerns

Before human head transplantation could enter the realm of consideration, scientists would have to perform multiple successful experiments on primates, Stephen Latham, a bioethicist at Yale University, says.

But say the primate experiments did pass the ethics test. And so did the human trials. The fact remains that a head transplant is a bit outrageous for the needs of most patients, Latham says.

Which gets at another ethical quandary: doctors might be motivated to perform head–switching operations for all the wrong reasons, Dr. Christopher Scott, a bioethicist and regenerative medicine expert at Stanford, worries. “You’d have to make sure the motivations are around a true medical need, and not some desire to be famous,” he says. “These questions have been raised before, in procedures like face transplants.”

####The Question of Person hood

In true bioethicist fashion, Scott notes that the surgery would raise some thorny philosophical questions, chief among them what makes us human: “What is the donor and what’s the recipient?” he says. “We all have an idea of personhood, right? Of what a person is. You know, a baby or a human becomes a person. And this procedure turns it on its head. Is this a person that the body belongs to, or the person the head belongs to? It’s a chimera, a hybrid person. …Those are some of the deeper questions that we should have a real discussion about.”

####Who is the donor and who is the receiver?

I agree with the above comment – ‘If you’d have the technology to attach spinal columns, you’d certainly have developed the technology to repair somebody’s broken spinal column,’. The reasons for performing this procedure in my mind seem to be grossly inadequate. I find it very interesting where the article explores the notion of personhood. Personally I would place more emphasis upon the head as a recognisable part of the persona. If you see someone in the street with their head on a different body, you would recognise them, even if something looked different. However, if one saw the friends body, but with a different head, I very much doubt anyone would recognise it. However, one would be becoming a hybrid, personally I am not sure if I could use another persons body, there is something a little too strange there for me. Perhaps if we reach this level of technology, robotic bodies could be made to get around the issue of personhood at some level. One could argue all day concerning the issues surrounding personhood and respect of the body with

legitimate cause. However, one thing is for sure, if the technology is there to repair spinal cords, I see no reason for humans to ‘switch bodies’.
