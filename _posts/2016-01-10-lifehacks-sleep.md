Do you have trouble falling asleep? Don't you worry, many do too! Or rather, only a few lucky one's have that magical ability to fall asleep as soon as they hit the bed. Failing to fall asleep on-time usually results in you sleeping for lesser hours than recommended (7-9 hours). This inadvertently takes a toll on various aspects of your life like job performance, relationships, and your overall health. Well, fret not! Here, we've compiled the best and simple hacks help you fall asleep quickly. 
  
####1. Relax your mind 
 
It generally is all in your head. From at least an hour before you sleep, try to stop thinking about the things that stress you out, like your job, your future, or that humiliating moment. Instead, think or do something peaceful or relaxing, like thinking about beach, the waves, or praying (if you are religious). You can completely clear your negative thoughts by following some meditation too. Once you've calmed your mind down and if you are a bit tired from the days work, you won't find much trouble falling asleep quickly. 
 
####2. Keep electronics far away 
 
Turn-off your televisions, tablets, and smartphones 2 hours before you go to sleep. They tempt to engage in restless activities and keep you awake. You are better off with removing all electronic devices from your bedroom, except for an alarm perhaps.  
 
####3. Avoid naps during the day 
 
Try not to nap if you possibly can. If you really need to sleep, then limit to a power nap of 20 minutes or less. Anything over that will probably ruin your sleep for the night. 
 
####4. Workout 
 
We all know that exercising improves our health, but it also helps improving the quality of sleep by reducing stress. But keep in mind to finish your exercises at least 3 hours before you got to bed, to prevent the adrenaline from kicking in during your sleeping hours. It is always better to workout during the mornings – helps you start the day feeling fresh and full of energy! 
 
####5. Have a proper dinner 
 
Have a dinner that is rich in carbohydrates, potassium and magnesium which help in relaxing your mind and body. As a pro tip, You can have a banana which contains relaxing compounds along with some green tea or warm milk before you got to sleep.  
Try to avoid having a spicy and greasy dinner! 
 
####6. Listen to Music or white noise 
 
Listening to soothing music or white noise at low volumes helps you relax your body and make for a restful night. It also helps you overcome any annoying noises that prevent you from falling asleep. 
 
####7. Avoid Alcohol 
 
Recent studies show that alcohol causes restless sleep, although it may initially help you fall asleep. So, if your priority is to sleep well, then you must stay away from alcohol. 
 
####8. Prepare your body 
 
Try preparing your body by following some progressive relaxation technique. You can also take a nice warm bath before going to sleep.
