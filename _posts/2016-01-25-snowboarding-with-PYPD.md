Whilst most of the NYC was 'chilling' during the heavy snow, Casey Neistat and a fellow YouTuber Jesse Wellens decided to get adventurous. This resulted in creation of one of the most awesome and viral video this year. The youtubers along with a couple of friends set out from their studio in a Jeep Wrangler on Saturday, armed with a GoPro, several cameras, and a drone to capture their adventure. 

In the 2 and a half minute video, Casey and Jesse is seen being rope-towed around the mostly empty streets of NYC while being cheered by the pedestrians as if it was some snowboard park.

All the attention did led them to be pulled over by the cops, but listen to what an unidentified cop had to say: 

"Someone complained about you, so we're going to act like we're talking to you,"  

"You guys are awesome," replies Neistat.

The video 'Snowboarding with the NYPD' has so far been viewed well over 5 million times. 

Neistat himself is a highly respected and followed youtube personality with about 2 million subscribers. Some of his popular and influential videos include taking the NYPD to task over bike lane regulations and iPod's Dirty Secret, in which he takes Apple to task over their lack of battery support, which went viral and forced the computer giant to change their policy.
