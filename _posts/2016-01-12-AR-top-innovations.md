Augmented Reality (AR) provides a live physical view of real-world environment combined with computer generated input such as information, graphics, video, sound and /or GPS data. AR has been around for quite a while now, but it was only restricted to be employed for specific tasks in highly advanced industries like aviation and energy. Technology has now greatly advanced and become more glabalized.   
Nowadays, AR is easily available to the masses generally in the form consumer electronics like smartphone and tablets, which was initially made mainstream by Sony with their AR camera. Other industries like gaming and automobile are also building some exciting and innovative products. So here's out list of the most innovative AR products currently in development. 

####Leap motion's AR computing 
Leap motion is an American company that manufactures a finger and hand motion sensor device (non touching). During one of their hackathons, a team of Leap's developers created a demo which reimagines a standard computer as a super cool 3D workstation! Take a look for yourself!

They built this demo using prototype Leap sensor, and an Oculus rift developer-kit.

####Magic leap's AR demo + game 
Magic leap is a mysterious, insanely funded (reportedly $1+ Billion) US based AR startup. Nothing's much known except for the two awesome videos that were released by them. The first video titled "Just another day in office at Magic Leap" shows some mind-blowing work that they're doing, which also includes an out of the world gameplay of some random game. Have a look!

Their second video shows more of their work without the use of special effects, that is, an actual footage from their product.
