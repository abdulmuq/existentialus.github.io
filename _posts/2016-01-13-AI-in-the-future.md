Movies like Terminator, I-Robot and Ex-Machina made us directly co-relate Artificial Intelligence with humanoid robots. But, that's rarely the case. In today's world, Artificial Intelligence is vastly diversified and its applications are focussed greatly on some particular task or function, and that's mostly because we're still decades away from achieving anything close to human level Artificial Intelligence. Undoubtedly though, AI is still one of the most fascinating fields of technology right now. 
Artificial intelligence has always been a subject of great interest and debate for past many decades, and will be for many more to come. Therefore, here's what you need to know about the major roles of AI in the near future. 
 
####Human like AI? There's still a long way to go! 
 
Today, we've successfully created machines programmed to clean your floor, answer your reasonably complex queries and even automatically drive you around, but developing anything close to a human's 'common sense' or 'self awareness' is proving to be a near impossible task.  
Sir Nigel Shadbolt, a Professor of Computer Science at Oxford University says, "Telling a joke, making an ethical judgment, deciding that you want to collaborate with some individuals and not others -- this rich texture of human life isn't there in our machines at all." "That spark of awareness in your head, we don't know where that comes from," says Shadbolt. He also jokes about the biggest misconception of public concerning the AI, "That it's just 10 years down the road." 
Artificial Intelligence might be able to play chess better than you or score more grades than you did, but it's still decades away from achieving a complete human like intelligence.

####Killer robots 
 
Looking towards the future of AI, there's always been the fear of it taking over humanity as portrayed in movies like I-Robot. There seem's a great possibility of this happening, but not like as we are made to believe by the movies and media. The real danger comes from the autonomous war weapons; from unmanned drones, to sentry robots. These technologies are frighteningly under continuous development by many of the world's governments. The current state of these machines require very little input from humans to make the kills, which in the recent upcoming future might become fully automated.  
 
There are more than 50 non-governmental organizations fighting against such killer robots. One of such organizations is The Future of Life Institute, which recently published an open letter signed by hundreds of AI researchers and famous tech personalities, warning, "If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow." A good thing to know is that these NGO's claim that they're making progress towards a treaty, one akin to the international agreement outlawing chemical weapons. The UN has already hosted discussions on the subject of autonomous murderbots. 
 
####Animal AI before human AI? 
 
To crack the hard shell to human AI development. A few scientist's are suggesting a totally unique route to developing the human AI based on the theory of evolution. That is, by developing an animal's (Ape) AI model, and then proceeding in a stage by stage manner until finally developing an equivalent model of human Intelligence. 
So, in the near future there's a good chance of sighting some robotic ape's in the zoo!  
 
 
Fundamentally, the face of modern AI is more task centric and diverse intelligent systems. Though mindless for now, but changing every aspect of human life. Today's Artificial Intelligence is nothing like how it was expected to be a few years back, it is highly fascinating and intriguing nonetheless. Hence, do expect the AI of the future to be surprisingly different and more fascinating than our current thoughts and expectations.
