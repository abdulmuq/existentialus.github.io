These days, being smart in a competitive world is a grand necessity. To stand out from the already competitive crowd, people need to better themselves by putting in that extra effort. This article shows you how to do that in an easy and practical way. 
There is a common misconception that people who are good at math are generally smarter than everyone else, but this is necessarily not the case. Others might be much better than them in creative arts or literature. Our brains are wired differently, hence, intelligence varies across various fields of study and work from person to person. 
You might ask, what exactly makes people smart.. Well, acquiring new information, a new skill, or developing an already learned skill - all contribute to you becoming smarter! 
So, here is our list of seven ways of making yourselves smarter everyday! 

####1. Read a lot! 
We start off with the best of ways to make you smarter - reading. Reading, no matter what you read, be it blogs, comics, manuals, terms and conditions (just kidding) - gains you more knowledge. Reading intellectual books certainly is more beneficial.  
We say this based on many popular studies, which state reading to be one of the most intellectually and spiritually beneficial activities. A simple google search will lead you to many sources online that help you choose a perfect book based to your interests. If you really hate reading or if you have a short span of concentration, then you may find an audio book helpful, this again is offered by many websites online. 

####2. Become a holistic learner 
If you'd like to become a living Wikipedia, holistic learning is the art you need to master. This is the learning art in which you learn some new information by linking it to something you knew previously. Hence, forming a chain of information links helps you understand the context of whatever you're learning much better and stays in your memory for longer period of times. 
Mastering the art of hollistic learning requires extra effort, but believe us, it is well worth it! Students especially can benefit greatly by employing this learning method. 

####3. Make lists 
Make list of what you've accomplished and what need's to be.  
Intelligence is directly proportional to confidence and happiness. So, making an 'I did' list helps you gain confidence and happiness, hence intelligence. 
The fastest and easiest way of growing smarter is fulfilling your own definition of smart. So, write down a to do list with skills and activities that help you fulfill your definition of smartness. 

####4. Hang out with smart friends 
One of the quickest way to get smarter is to have smart friends. Hanging out with people who are cleverer than you might be a little rough on your self esteem, but it really is beneficial.  
Accepting your mental capacity and being open to learning from people helps you in overcoming your self esteem issues. 

####5. Utilize your time online smartly 
Social networks take up a huge heap of time from most people's lives. Restrict your social media usage, and instead increase your smarts by going through some resourceful content like Ted talks and online courses.  
You can also follow some interesting YouTube educators like Veritasium and Vsauce – more informative than watching a dog roller skating or a kitten meowing. 
As the famous quote goes “Time is money”, so be careful of how you spend it. 

####6. Do Random things 
Doing random things may not only result in you learning something you never expected to, but you may also end up exploring your potential interests.  
Here's a famous Steve Jobs quote “You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future”. Doing Random things helps disperse these dots, which in turn might help you out in connecting some missing dots in your path. 

####7. Play Board when you're bored 
Fun to play board games and puzzles are a great way of exercising your brains. Also, games like tetris are proven to increase adolescent brain's gray matter, and efficiency in others. 
There are tons of board games and puzzles for different devices, hence getting your hands on some these puzzles and games is easier than ever! 
Getting bored? Start playing!
