Three new cars from Volvo, Buick and Cadillac will not show a Made in China label. But those cars are breaking new ground in the auto industry, becoming the first to be manufactured in the People’s Republic and exported to the United States.

 

Sweden’s **Volvo**, now owned by Geely Auto of China, has shipped more than 1,000 copies of its **S60** cars.

The west built the modern car plant.  The east and the orient is now owning car manufacturing for US and Global Automakers.          

 

There are also a slew of local Chinese manufacturers waiting to get out of China and conquer the world.

 

We think it is just a question of time.

 

See a list of cars below that are made in China.
