![Existential - The perfect smartphone](/img/perfectphone2.jpg)
 
Buying a smartphone these days is a pretty arduous task. That's particularly because of the sheer number of smartphones being pumped out by more than a hundred manufacturers every year.  
No smartphone is really "perfect" across the board, but you can buy a phone which is perfect (or almost perfect) for YOU. Some may prefer the best performance phone, some camera, some battery, good display, and some may prefer to have all of it. 
There are many top smartphone lists out there, these lists might help you buy a very good phone, but not the perfect one you desire. In this article, I am not going to say which smartphone is the best and which is not, but I am going to help you choose your perfect smartphone by guiding you step by step through the important factors which one has to consider while buying a smartphone. I'll try and keep it simple and precise!  

####Operating system 
Operating system is the most important factor one has to consider while buying a smartphone. No matter how well equipped a smartphone may be, but if you don't like (after spending some time of-course) how you interact with your phone, you will NOT like the phone. There currently 4 major operating systems – Android, iOS, Windows and BlackBerry.  
*Android is an open source operating system which has the largest smartphone user base in the world. Android is highly customizable, provides easy root access and its fairly user friendly. Most phone manufacturers like Samsung, LG, HTC and Sony use Android as their main operating system.  
*Apple's iOS is the most user friendly smartphone OS. Together with Apple's own high quality hardware, iOS has the least amount of lag. It also has the least customization options. Only Apple's iPhones operate on iOS. 
*Windows OS is recently gaining popularity with the recently released Windows 10 and continuum. Windows is also fairly user friendly, but with little customization. If you are a big fan of Windows operating system, you'll love a Windows 10 for mobile too. Microsoft is the major manufacturer, with many other joining the party soon! 
*BlackBerry OS is still the most secure operating system currently available. It is still relevant, but slowly losing ground due to lack of app support. 

####Build/hardware preferences 

Phones these days come in many shapes and sizes. Therefore, consider your preferences on the following characteristics: 
*Display size – This is a major point to consider while buying a smartphone. Sizes generally vary from 3.5" to all the way *up to 6.5" (phablet territory). 4.5" - 5.2" is generally the sweet spot, many prefer otherwise too. 
*Build Material – See if you prefer a fully metal clad phone (beautiful and highly slippery), or a full plastic/rubber *build (most durable) or an metal and glass sandwiched (beautiful and slippery) phone 
*Color – Check if your favorite color option is available 
*Button placement – Especially, be aware of the power button placement 
*Ergonomics – Handle the phone for some time before you buy it 
*Dimensions – Not all that important, but can help you decide when you're stuck up with similar devices 
*Single sim/double sim 
*Memory card expansion 
 
####Display

A good display is a MUST in a smartphone. There are quite a few things to consider as shown below: 
*Resolution – Depending on your screen size, choose resolutions from 720p to 1440p. Anything below that will ruin your on *screen experience. Anything above 1440p is an overkill and eat up your battery while making no (literally) change to the *visual experience. So, for a 5" screen, 1080p is your best bet. 
*Display technology – AMOLED, IPS and OLED displays are the best one's out there. 
*Display protection – Be sure that your choice of phone has a good (atleast Gorilla glass 3) protection. Cracked screens can lead to depression (wink wink ;) 

####Connectivity options 
Most of the phones these days usually come equipped with general connectivity options like 4g, dual-band wifi, hotspot and Bluetooth, but it's important not ignore these options, specially if you import the phone from China. I say China because Chinese have different network bands, and since most of the phones are made in China for Chinese, and they may not support your local network bands.  

####Battery life 
Smartphone battery life depends on how you use your phone. You don't have to fret over battery life if you are a light user, or if you don't mind charging your phone more often (also depends on ease of access). If you are a medium or a heavy user, you must consider getting a phone with a good battery life. There are numerous sources online that give you a detailed report smartphones battery life.Generally speaking, phablets have much better battery life compared to their smaller counterparts. 
From my knowledge and research, here are a few mainstream smartphones that have great endurance; starting of with smaller screen phones: Sony Xperia Z3C, Sony Xperia Z5C, Samsung Galaxy S6 Active, Samsung Galaxy S5, Sony Xperia Z3, LG G2, Motorolla DROID Turbo, iPhone 6+ and 6s+, Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and 5, Meizu PRO 5, Samsung Galaxy A8, and Huawei Ascend Mate 2. 

####Performance 
Unless you perform heavy tasks like gaming regularly, any mid-ranger and above would do just fine. The hands-down best performing phones currently on market are iPhone 6s and 6s plus. The latest iPhones perform about 40% better than any other phones. Currently, there is practically no use for such performance. This is not to say that other phones are underpowered - performance from every manufacturers flagship phones is much more than adequate, it's just that iPhones are overpowered. 

####Applications 
Whichever platform you choose, make sure that your regularly used applications are available. For the time being, iOS has the most number of applications, closely followed by Android. Windows and BlackBerry have most of the essential applications, but many other applications are still lagging - more so on BlackBerry OS. 

####Camera 
Conventional camera's are largely being replaced by smartphone cameras. Therefore, having a great smartphone camera is a necessity these days. You need to be careful while comparing cameras though, specially when you are buying from unknown brands. Higher 'megapixels' doesn't necessarily mean higher quality output, but rather, it’s the sensor which you need to vary about. Generally, sensors from Sony are considered the best, followed by Samsung and PureView. There are a lot of other factors that come into play too like pixel size, aperture, lens and camera software.  
Well, if you don't like to go deep into technical comparison, then we recommend you to at least go through some camera review samples available in abundance online before you make your buying decision. 

####Audio performance 
Some phones have really poor loudspeaker performance. Hence, confirm if the speaker performance is adequate, so that you don't end up missing important calls and notifications.  
For the heavy media consumers out there, get a phone with front facing stereo speakers, and you'll thank me later. 
Headphone audio performance on current generation phones is mostly adequate for average users. So unless you're an audiophile, you won't be having much problems here. 

####Conclusion 
This article focuses on helping you familiarize with the important smartphone features. It also helps you prioritize the features depending on your needs.  
Once, you've finalized a few smartphones, high quality smartphone reviewing websites like gsmarena.com, notebookcheck.net and anandtech.com will help you make your final buying decision!
