#####**Multi-tasking is probably killing you and here’s how you can fix it.**

It is no secret that in today’s world, most of us try to multi-task gets stuff done. Studies by Stanford researchers show have however shown that multi-tasking is even bad for your health and may be impairing cognitive ability.

 

Empirical evidence suggested that it is impossible to process more than one string of information at a time. The brain cannot focus and just can’t do it.

 

A few special multi-taskers were thought to have great control over their senses and therefore they might have a special gift. However, that is not true.

 

Stanford researches Stan Nass and his colleagues Eyal Ophir and Anthony Wagner, set out to learn what gives multi-taskers their edge. What is their gift?

 

#####**Groups were split into two. Those who multitasked and those who didn’t.**  

 

In one experiment, the groups were shown sets of two red rectangles alone or surrounded by two, four or six blue rectangles. Each configuration was flashed twice, and the participants had to determine whether the two red rectangles in the second frame were in a different position than in the first frame.

 

They were told to ignore the blue rectangles, and the low multitaskers had no problem doing that. But the high multitaskers were constantly distracted by the irrelevant blue images. Their performance was horrible.

 

Because the high multitaskers showed they couldn't ignore things, the researchers figured they were better at storing and organizing information. Maybe they had better memories.

 

The second test proved that theory wrong. After being shown sequences of alphabetical letters, the high multitaskers did a lousy job at remembering when a letter was making a repeat appearance.

 

"The low multitaskers did great," Ophir said. "The high multitaskers were doing worse and worse the further they went along because they kept seeing more letters and had difficulty keeping them sorted in their brains."

 

#####**Still puzzled**

 

Puzzled but not yet stumped on why the heavy multitaskers weren't performing well, the researchers conducted a third test. If the heavy multitaskers couldn't filter out irrelevant information or organize their memories, perhaps they excelled at switching from one thing to another faster and better than anyone else.

 

#####**Wrong again, the study found.**

 

The test subjects were shown images of letters and numbers at the same time and instructed what to focus on. When they were told to pay attention to numbers, they had to determine if the digits were even or odd. When told to concentrate on letters, they had to say whether they were vowels or consonants.

 

Again, the heavy multitaskers underperformed the light multitaskers.

 

"They couldn't help thinking about the task they weren't doing," Ophir said. "The high multitaskers are always drawing from all the information in front of them. They can't keep things separate in their minds."

 

#####**Multi-tasking Damages the brain.**

The researchers are still studying whether chronic media multitaskers are born with an inability to concentrate or are damaging their cognitive control by willingly taking in so much at once. But they're convinced the minds of multitaskers are not working as well as they could.

 

"When they're in situations where there are multiple sources of information coming from the external world or emerging out of memory, they're not able to filter out what's not relevant to their current goal," said Wagner, an associate professor of psychology. "That failure to filter means they're slowed down by that irrelevant information."

 

So how do you not do multi-tasking and gain more?

 

#####**Do one task at a time .**

 

So maybe it's time to stop e-mailing if you're following the game on TV, and rethink singing along with the radio if you're reading the latest news online. By doing less, you might accomplish more.

 

#####**Give enough time.**

We are switching between multiple tasks because sometimes we give too little time for our tasks to finish.  The most important thing that we tend to do is allocate very little time for our tasks to finish. Giving enough time ensures that you can completely complete a task before you jump to another task.

 

#####**Do less, have fewer goals.**

 

All of us want to be rock stars. But the fact of the matter is that we are not. You can only get to great from good, not from mediocre. By doing less, you will feel less stressed and will be able to perform better than your mediocre self if you’re multitasking. Therefore, do less.
